In this project our team focus on dealing with images.

Given a target image, the application "evolves" a new image from a population of random pixels.  It is intended to be a gentle solution using genetic algorithms, using Java. The images are supposed to be Black and White, and more complex topics like RGB pixels, high resolution images, etc., have not been included.
